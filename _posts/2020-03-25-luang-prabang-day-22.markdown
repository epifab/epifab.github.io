Luang Prabang, day 22.

Homesick is a pain that I am used to.  
It hits me every single time my dad drives me to the airport in my home town,
where a brutal one way flight to London awaits.

Homesick is a grief, everybody deals with it in a different way.
Me, for example, I book a return flight immediately after landing.
My antidote is a very well defined date to hold on to, something to wait for.
It's a specific set of habits and rituals.
It's the idea of climbing the stairs and smell my favourite dish up in the air once again, 
and behind the door there is mum and her hug. Home.

All flights are being cancelled, all borders are officially closing down for another month,
but everybody knows that's just the first one, there will be many more after.
Home has never been so far away, and all certainties we had just crashed on a wall and fell apart.

Outside of this comfortable little luxurious corner, a speaker is repeatedly announcing road by road - in lao -
what we believe to be the imminent lockdown.
The wind blows violently through the palm trees, yet another storm is coming.
Everything has changed since we arrived here, those long walks through the beautiful night market are gone.
Luang Prabang has suddenly turned into an unwelcoming place where locals appear afraid of us, dismissive.
Only now we recognise the pattern, those stories that we read about other backpackers in Cambodia,
or episodes of racism against Chinese people in Italy, in England and pretty much everywhere on the globe.

If we even thought we could live in Luang Prabang, the truth is that we're not ready for it.
