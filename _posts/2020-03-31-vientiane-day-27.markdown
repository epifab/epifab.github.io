Vientiane, day 27.

As things move fast prepare to feel lost and to live alternate moments of unexplainable euphoria and pure panic.  
We met some new friends along the way. Sharing the path with decent people really makes the difference.  
We support each other, we brainstorm ideas, we hope, we laugh and occasionally even forget about this mess.  
We jumped on this minivan before it was too late, something like 9 hours journey on a ridiculously dangerous,
disastered and scenic road through the mountains to finally get stuck here, prisoners in this hotel.

Sometimes I just float like an algae on the swimming pool for hours (or minutes, whatever time means to you).  
It is all about breathing: inhaling deeply will lift you up, exhaling will pull you down.  
The perfect rhythm will open the gate of calmness and tranquility. As I stare at the sky with my ears immersed,
voices and noises from the outer reality get muffled and all our problems vanish into that big bright star,
that is most definitely a planet, but I don't give a shit and call it a star, cause that's the whole point of it.  

Meantime, someone is playing "Rocket Man" by Elton John, and somehow everything is just perfect.
