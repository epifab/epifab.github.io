One of the good sides of walking in Jodhpur, is that you can basically fart anywhere on the street and nobody will ever notice. The sun hits hard, and the atmosphere is dry and dusty. The smell ranges from intense to extreme: a unique blend of spices, excrement, garbage and smog. If you’re one of those farting English club goers you’ve nothing to worry about.

The centre of Jodhpur is a intricate maze of very narrow roads. rickshaws and motorbikes wave in and out at crazy speed honking constantly. The street knows no rule except perhaps one, figured out only later in my trip: the biggest and fastest vehicle has precedence. As there are no sidewalks (as you would expect) if you’re on foot you’re simply out of luck, which will turn even the shortest walk into a potential nightmare.

On a normal day, streets are very busy, with thousands of market stands selling fruit, veg and cheese (no meet, no fish), local clothes, fabrics and various accessories. Local people immerse in their surprisingly chilled daily lives, either when they’re rushing somewhere or they’re just hanging on the street, sitting outside of their blue houses, until the sun is gone and beyond.
