I'm in this place, where my brother Carlo lives.  
Well, I know he's my brother, except that he doesn't look like him at all.  
Whoever he is, this chap shares the room with an happy family of bats.  
They fly around a huge antique wooden wardrobe, occasionally turning into penguins,
seagulls and other magic birds.
"It must be harsh to live with these lovely creatures shitting everywhere", I thought. my brother didn't deny it.  
Almost time to leave, when this cat turned up.  
Something interesting about it: it doesn't freak me out.  
Why?  
Firstly because it doesn't do cats stuff, like sinisterly staring at you and attacking for no reason,
secondly (and arguably more importantly) because he has human blue eyes and speaks a majestic queen's english.
We ended up chatting about this random 13th dimension and past lives.
He once was a Dutch gardener, he says.  
I remember I was observing these baby dragons flying around the wardrobe 
when I asked him if he still had some of that gardened stuff.  
A couple of seconds later a very different voice replied: "I'm not that kind of gardener".
I turned my face and he's a freaking real cat now, doing its freaking cats stuff.

And I freaked out.
And I woke up,
Sweaty,
and drunk.
